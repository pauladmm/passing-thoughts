# Passing Thoughts :thought_balloon:

The original idea is from a [Codecademy Project](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) called Passing Thoughts, from the Full-Stack Engineer Career Path.

## Description
Is a web app where you can write down thoughts and it will disappear in 15 seconds.

I liked the idea because sometimes when I have to deal with intrusive thoughts, I have to remember myself that I am not my thoughts, but I had them indeed, and have to let them pass to finally disappear.
Here, I can write what I am thinking, like a brainstorm, and without making any judge about my thoughts. And then, I can literally watch them disappear. So they stop occuping my mental space.

Once you write what's on your mind, you can either:
- Delete them :x:
- Wait 15 seconds until they fly away.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You write what's on your mind and click Add or just press Enter button.

And then in 15 seconds they just disappear.

## Featuring :wrench:

I pretend to keep building this project and improving the appearance.
